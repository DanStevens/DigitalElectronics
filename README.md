# Ben Eater's 8-bit breadboard computer - in code!

I was watching YouTuber Ben Eater's video series on building an [8-bit breadboard computer](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU&si=5VQzhQfZGRd30bCy) and wanted to follow along but I wasn't so interested in playing with breadboard and bits of wire.

Instead, I applied what I learnt from watching the videos to create a library for modeling simple digital electronic circuits, coded in C#.

Logic gates form the most basic components, which are used to construct the electronic components that Ben Eater describes in his videos, such as latches and flip-flops. These components are used to construct the high-level modules of a CPU such as the bus, registers, ALU, ROM, RAM and address decoders.
